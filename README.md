- Input phone number to retrieve public SIM details
- Logs search history (optional)
- User-friendly command-line interface
- Designed with privacy in mind, ensuring no access to sensitive/private data

## Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **API**: Uses public telecom APIs or mock data (depending on your setup)
- **Libraries**:
  - `requests` for API calls
  - `argparse` for handling command-line arguments
  - `logging` for logging search history
  - Optional: `sqlite3` if you decide to store query history locally
